#Personal Website

Personal website to help boost resume
built using typescript, scss, html

idea behind this is that I would have a bussiness card with QR code or a resume QR code to go to the website
where they can then find my resume, skillsets and pictures of projects I worked on

(site)[zain.accucalc.com] <- should go to the site itself

//TODO:
include a github readme stats card under Proof of Experience themed black and red
I took the pictures as reference or to remember certain things, change them out to something more showcasy
I have some better PCBs I made, showcase those
have the pictures expand, include some kind of way for the pictures to either go to a github link
or show a very basic explanation of how it was made/why/skills it used
find a way to count how many clicks have happened onto my website
update my resume it is not up to date with my actual resume
