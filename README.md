#Personal Website

I think that a small personal website would help boost my resume a little

using typescript, and scss, deployable website located in dist/ which is actual compiler output

dev commands


```
sass --watch src/scss:dist/css
sudo npx tsc --watch
sudo npx http-server -o index.html
```
